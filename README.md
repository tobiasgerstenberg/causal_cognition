Causality is central to our understanding of the world and of each other. We think causally when we predict what will happen in the future, infer what happened in the past, and interpret other people's actions and emotions. Causality is intimately linked to explanation -- to answering questions about why something happened. In this discussion-based seminar class, we will first read foundational work in philosophy that introduces the main frameworks for thinking about causation. We will then read some work on formal and computational theories of causation that was inspired by these philosophical frameworks. Equipped with this background, we will study the psychology of causal learning, reasoning, and judgment. We will tackle questions such as: How can we learn about the causal structure of the world through observation and active intervention? What is the relationship between causal reasoning and mental simulation? Why do we select to talk about some causes over others when several causes led to an outcome? Toward the end of the course, we will discuss how what we have learned about causation in psychology may inform other fields of inquiry, such as legal science as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### General information

#### What to expect? 

In ["A Vision for Stanford"](https://ourvision.stanford.edu/), university president Marc Tessier-Lavigne states that Stanford wants to be 

>"an inspired, inclusive and collaborative community of diverse scholars, students and staff, where all are supported and empowered to thrive." 

Let's try our best together in this seminar to make this happen! 

##### What you can expect from me

_I will ..._

- be in class 5 minutes before it starts to set up and stay 10 minutes afterwards for questions. 
- start and end each class on time. 
- meet with you to discuss the handout during [office hours](#course-info) on Friday before class.
- provide an introduction to the field of causal cognition in the first session. 
- help facilitate the discussion in subsequent sessions. 
- send announcements via Canvas to guide the reading for each upcoming week. 

##### What I expect from you 

_You will ..._

- attend all of [the classes](#schedule) and participate in class discussion.
- lead the discussion for one session in class (you may use slides to help structure the discussion). 
- prepare a handout for the session that you're leading. 
- discuss the handout with me during office hours __on Friday before your presentation__. 
- write short [reaction papers](#reaction-posts) based on the readings and upload each paper on Canvas by 10pm (at the latest) the night before class. 
- write a final paper (and submit a paper proposal). 
- students who audit the class are expected to write reaction posts and participate in discussion in class. 

#### Grading 

- 40% final paper
- 20% handout and leading discussion 
- 20% reaction posts to readings
- 20% participation and discussion in class

##### Final paper

The final project may be one of the following three: 

1. An empirical project proposal. 
2. A literature review based on one of the class topics. 
3. An essay. 
	- Here is a list of example essay questions: 
		+ What is the relationship between causal cognition and causal perception? 
		+ In what way are counterfactual thinking and causal thinking related? 
		+ How many concepts of causation are there? What are the arguments in favor of causal pluralism versus a unified concept of causation? 
		+ What role does causality play in artificial intelligence? 
		+ Should legal theorists care about the ordinary person's concept of causation? 
		+ How do children and adults learn about the causal structure of the world? 

A short final paper proposal (1/2 page) will be due on __May, 26th at 10pm__. 

The final paper (2000--3000 words) will be due on __June, 9th at 10pm__. 

##### Reaction posts 

Here are some guiding thoughts on how to write a good reaction post: 

- Structure your posts (headings, subheadings, etc.). 
- Express your opinion rather than summarize the paper(s).
- Try to connect the ideas expressed in the paper to concrete every-day experiences. 
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of the paper. 
- Relate different papers to each other. 
- Ask questions that go beyond what the paper discusses (what's missing, where should we go next)? 

The reaction posts should be concise (one or two paragraphs per paper), and should be submitted by __Sunday at 10pm__ the latest via Canvas.  

#### Policies 

Please familiarize yourself with [Stanford's honor code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code). We will adhere to it and follow through on its penalty guidelines. <br>

([OAE](https://oae.stanford.edu/)). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.
